# Beyond Mod 0 Plan

### Academic
*plan for retaining information, and improving comprehension before mod 1*
1. Convert and consolidate physical notes to searchable digital notes.
    - I want to ensure that my notes are accurate, concise and easy to reference for assignments and tests, so I'll be transfering them to a digital note taking platform. This will help me solidify comprehension of the materials discussed, as well as prepare to take better notes while I'm in mod 1.
2. Review lessons to identify problem areas and improve.
    - I plan on doing a brief review of each lesson over the next week, scheduling time for each lesson on my Calendar. This will help me identify any areas that I'm not fully understanding and allow me to improve. 
3. Read any mod 1 materials that are provided, especially those that will pertain to the first week.
    - I want to prepare questions, and prep for the concepts that we'll be tackling in mod 1, so if any of the lessons are available in the time between mod 0 and mod 1, I want to schedule time to read through the lessons.
4. Make changes to physical workspace.
    - Given the amount of time we'll be in class for mod 1, I want to make sure that my physical workspace is set up to help me stay comfortable while spending that much time at my computer. I plan on re-arranging my desk to make sure I have enough room. A trashcan to make sure that clutter from things like notes doesn't build up. I might also add a mini fridge to make sure I always have cold water so I can stay hydrated while I work.
