# Beyond Mod 0 Plan

### Academic
*plan for retaining information, and improving comprehension before mod 1*
1. Convert and consolidate physical notes to searchable digital notes.
    - I want to ensure that my notes are accurate, concise and easy to reference for assignments and tests, so I'll be transfering them to a digital note taking platform. This will help me solidify comprehension of the materials discussed, as well as prepare to take better notes while I'm in mod 1.
2. Review lessons to identify problem areas and improve.
    - I plan on doing a brief review of each lesson over the next week, scheduling time for each lesson on my Calendar. This will help me identify any areas that I'm not fully understanding and allow me to improve. 
3. Read any mod 1 materials that are provided, especially those that will pertain to the first week.
    - I want to prepare questions, and prep for the concepts that we'll be tackling in mod 1, so if any of the lessons are available in the time between mod 0 and mod 1, I want to schedule time to read through the lessons.
4. Make changes to physical workspace.
    - Given the amount of time we'll be in class for mod 1, I want to make sure that my physical workspace is set up to help me stay comfortable while spending that much time at my computer. I plan on re-arranging my desk to make sure I have enough room. A trashcan to make sure that clutter from things like notes doesn't build up. I might also add a mini fridge to make sure I always have cold water so I can stay hydrated while I work.


### Professional Relationships
*plan for continuing to build a relationship with my cohort and my small group.*
1. Continue to regularly check slack, and remain active in channels.
    - I currently check slack at least 3 times /day, in the morning, at lunch, and before I turn my computer off for the night. I will be continuing this schedule as well as making sure to continue to comment on threads and keep an active presence through between mod 0 and mod 1
2. Offer to study or work collaboratively using zoom.
    - I want to stay comfortable with talking and working in a zoom environment, so I will actively be trying to create opportunities to go into the dedicated study hall with other members of the cohort.
3. Reach out to ask for help, or share solutions that I've found.
    - I'll be sure to reach out on slack while I'm trying to improve comprehension. If there's any areas that I'm struggling with or if I find a solution to a problem that I think could help the cohort, I plan on asking for help or sharing my discoveries.

### Personal Relationships
*plan to maintain healthy relationships in my personal life.*
1. Have an in depth conversation with the people in my daily life.
    - I want to have a conversation about what responsibilities I'll need help with, and what I need to do to not over burden my family while I'm in school. I want to be sure to have all my personal responsibilities calendared as early as possible while making my way through the modules.
2. Spend some quality time with my family.
    - I know that the amount of time I'll be dedicating to Turing is going to be difficult for me and my family, so I want to be sure to take the opportunity to spend some time with them before mod 1 starts. We already have some plans set, so I'll be making sure to stick to my time managment strategies to ensure I'm meeting my accademic responsibilites.
3. Plan scheduled family time during mod 1
    - I know that I'm going to be struggling to pull myself away from my work during mod 1 and beyond, so I'm planning on doing everything I can to make sure that I can have at least 1 day a week that I can devote most of my time to them. I'm going to continue to work on my time managment, and calendaring skills so that I can keep to a schedule for completing my assignments as quickly as possible. If it's possible I don't want to work weekends, so I am comfortable with working early in the morning and late at night to give me a better chance at having more time with my family.
4. Schedule time to play with my dogs.
    - one area I've definitely been lacking in through mod 0, as far as my personal relationships go, is spending enough time with my dogs. Over the last 5 weeks I've haven't been giving enough time to my dogs, and it's been showing. They've gotten depressed and I really need to do better, so I'll be scheduling at least 15 minutes a day to play with them, and I'll try to re-arrange my early morning schedule to include some time before I start on assignments.
